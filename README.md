# StatsView
This is a web app for visualizing and analyzing data, and creating statistical reports. It supports charts, descriptive statistics, hypothesis tests, and confidence intervals, and can export to Word (recommended) or PDF (has some formatting quirks). It is built with Svelte and Vite.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/cdrice26/statsview.git`
2. Install dependencies: `npm install`
3. This depends on a custom library, [StatMaster](https://github.com/cdrice26/statmaster.git), which is not yet available on npm. To install it, follow the instructions in that repository.
4. Run the development server: `npm run dev`
5. Open the app in a browser: [http://localhost:5173/](http://localhost:5173/)
